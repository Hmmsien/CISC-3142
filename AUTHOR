My name is Huimin Chen. I am currently a student at Brooklyn College and majoring in Computer Science. My major goal is to become a software engineer. I look forward to having the ability to create an Application out of my ideas. And to be able to improve it continuously.
 And my hobby is playing Lego or puzzles. I enjoy the feeling of deciphering and looking forward to the completion of a piece.
